{ type: 'text', content: 'THE SORTING HAT<br><br>~Lucas Enters Hogwarts<br><br>Lucas Santos stood at the back of the crowd of first-years, his fingers twitching against the seam of his robe. His new Hogwarts uniform was still stiff from the packaging, and the castle loomed above him like something out of a bedtime story gone wild—ancient, alive, and watching.<br><br>He knew the names of the great witches and wizards carved above the gates. He knew the history of the founders and the rules of wand safety. He had read every book his dad could get his hands on since the letter came by owl.<br><br>But nothing had prepared him for the feeling.<br><br>Inside the Great Hall, candles floated in midair like lazy fireflies. The ceiling shimmered with the reflection of the stormy sky outside, and the long tables overflowed with older students in colored robes, watching the new arrivals with the kind of smirking curiosity that made Lucas’s stomach twist.<br><br>He reached up to touch the smooth wood of the Sorting Hat stool and swallowed hard.<br><br>“Lucas Santos,” Professor McGonagall called.<br><br>His legs moved before his brain could stop them.<br><br>I can do this, he thought. Just one hat. One decision. Then it’s done.<br><br>He sat down. The old Sorting Hat flopped onto his head—and at once, the world went quiet.<br><br>“Well, now… this is interesting.”<br><br>The voice filled his head like a warm whisper through a crackling fire.<br><br>“Curious mind, sharp eyes, and a heart that runs deep. You’ve got Ravenclaw wit and Hufflepuff loyalty—but oh, that stubborn streak... and such a hunger for action.”<br><br>Lucas didn’t say anything out loud, but his thoughts surged forward.<br><br>I want to do real things. Not just follow rules. I want to protect people—do something big. But… I want to belong, too.<br><br>The Hat chuckled, deep and knowing.<br><br>“Ah, so that’s it. You don’t just want to be brave—you want to be trusted with bravery. You’re a puzzle-piece boy looking for the right mission. Very well then…”<br><br>The Hat paused, as if savoring the moment.<br><br>“Better be… GRYFFINDOR!”<br><br>The last word rang out into the open air, and the hat was lifted from his head before Lucas could catch his breath.<br><br>The Gryffindor table erupted in applause. Lucas blinked in the light and scrambled off the stool, heart pounding.<br><br>A red-haired boy near the end of the table gave him a thumbs-up. “First one\'s the worst,” he said with a grin. “You’ll get used to it.”<br><br>Lucas slid into a seat beside him. “You’re… Ron Weasley, right?”<br><br>Ron blinked. “Er—yeah. Do I know you?”<br><br>“No. I just read a lot,” Lucas said quickly, ears burning.<br><br>Ron shrugged, still smiling. “Well, you’re lucky. Harry\'s on his way back from McGonagall’s office—he’ll want to meet you. And Hermione’s right there, trying not to correct the way I’m eating.”<br><br>“I heard that,” Hermione said, flicking a crumb at him.<br><br>Lucas laughed—his first real laugh since arriving.<br><br>He didn’t know what was coming next. But for the first time, he believed that maybe—just maybe—he was exactly where he needed to be.' },

{ type: 'text', content: 'The First Night in Gryffindor Tower<br><br>Lucas meets Harry, Ron, and Hermione—and notices something strange that others don’t.<br><br>The fire in the Gryffindor common room crackled like a beast trying to whisper. Warm reds and golds reflected off the cozy stone walls, and armchairs gathered near the hearth like friends telling secrets. Lucas sat perched on the edge of a velvet footstool, wide-eyed and alert.<br><br>Ron was sprawled on the rug, tossing Chocolate Frog cards into the air. Hermione knelt nearby with Crookshanks, who seemed deeply suspicious of everyone under twelve. And Harry Potter—yes, the Harry Potter—was across from Lucas, cross-legged with a grin that made him seem more like a friend than a legend.<br><br>“So you transferred from Castelobruxo?” Harry asked. “That’s the Brazilian wizarding school, right?”<br><br>Lucas nodded. “Only for a year. My dad’s an Auror on exchange—he’s helping with some international cooperation thing.”<br><br>“Cool,” Ron said, then winced. “Er—sorry, not cool that you had to leave your school, but… y’know, cool that your dad’s an Auror.”<br><br>Lucas smiled faintly. “It’s okay. Hogwarts is cooler. So far.”<br><br>Hermione looked up sharply. “Did you bring any magical creatures with you?”<br><br>“No,” Lucas said. “But I did bring this.”<br><br>From his pocket, he pulled a small silver puzzle cube etched with glyphs that shimmered when touched. “It’s charmed to shift every time you solve it. They gave it to me when I finished my wandwork trial early.”<br><br>Harry leaned forward, intrigued. “Can I try?”<br><br>Lucas hesitated. “Only if you promise not to break it. It gets grumpy.”<br><br>Harry laughed. “Grumpy puzzle cube. Got it.”<br><br>Just then, a soft click echoed through the room. It came from near the stairwell—barely audible over the fire.<br><br>Lucas’s head whipped around.<br><br>“Did you hear that?” he asked.<br><br>Ron frowned. “What?”<br><br>Lucas stood up, narrowing his eyes. “Something... just clicked. Like a lock. Or maybe... a secret door?”<br><br>Hermione followed his gaze. “There aren’t any hidden passages in the Gryffindor common room—well, not known ones.”<br><br>Lucas walked toward the wall beside the spiral staircase. There, nestled between two torches, was a tiny seam—a narrow line in the stone that didn’t match the rest. He pressed his fingers against it. Nothing.<br><br>But then—<br><br>Whrrr-click.<br><br>The wall shimmered. A panel slid back three inches, just enough to reveal a small square of parchment. Lucas snatched it.<br><br>“What the…” Harry stood beside him now.<br><br>Lucas unfolded the note. Written in neat, slanted script were four words:<br><br>“The map begins here.”<br><br>They stared at it. Hermione was already muttering about enchantments. Ron muttered something about not getting expelled.<br><br>Lucas’s mind raced. A hidden clue. A map. A mission.<br><br>His heart thudded in that way it did when something mattered.<br><br>He turned to Harry, eyes shining.<br><br>“Looks like I found my first Hogwarts mystery.”' },

{ type: 'text', content: 'The Clue Deepens<br><br>Lucas and the trio begin decoding the map—and discover something unexpected in the castle.<br><br>By morning, the parchment still hadn’t changed.<br><br>Lucas had tucked it into the inside pocket of his robe, checking it every hour between classes. Despite a flurry of whispered spells from Hermione and some light prodding from Ron’s wand ("Just a tap!" he\'d insisted), the parchment remained perfectly blank—aside from those four original words:<br><br>The map begins here.<br><br>It was maddening. Lucas wasn’t used to puzzles that stayed quiet this long.<br><br>By the time lunch rolled around, he was nearly vibrating with frustration. They gathered again at the Gryffindor table, and Lucas could barely touch his food.<br><br>“I’m telling you, it has to be voice-activated,” he said. “Or maybe tied to a location.”<br><br>“What if it’s like the Marauder’s Map?” Harry said, voice low. “It only reveals itself with a password.”<br><br>Lucas\'s eyes lit up. “You have one of those?!”<br><br>“Had,” Harry corrected. “Filch confiscated it last year after—well, long story. But it looked just like this. Blank parchment. Same enchanted feel to it.”<br><br>Lucas pulled out the paper and set it on the table, half-covered by a plate of shepherd’s pie.<br><br>“All right,” he whispered, leaning close. “If it’s a password… maybe it’s in the phrasing. The map begins here. What if that’s the key?”<br><br>He tapped it with his wand and said, “The map begins here.”<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Ron shrugged. “Worth a try.”<br><br>Hermione peered at it. “It’s written in a wizarding shorthand I’ve only seen in older texts—maybe it needs to be read in front of something.”<br><br>Lucas froze. “Like a mirror.”<br><br>They all looked at him.<br><br>“There’s an old mirror at the end of the Charms corridor,” he said. “I passed it on the way to class. The glass is all foggy and cracked, like it’s been there forever.”<br><br>“I’ve seen it too,” Hermione murmured. “It’s not in any of the floor plans. I thought it was just a decorative relic.”<br><br>Harry stood up. “Let’s go after dinner.”<br><br>That evening, with the parchment carefully hidden under Lucas’s robes, they snuck past a snoring portrait of the Fat Lady and crept along the corridors under Harry’s trusty Invisibility Cloak.<br><br>The mirror was exactly where Lucas remembered—half-covered by a faded velvet curtain, its frame carved with moons and owls. Something about it felt ancient. Expectant.<br><br>Lucas stepped in front of it and held up the parchment.<br><br>At first, nothing.<br><br>Then—<br><br>A shimmer.<br><br>The ink rearranged itself in rippling strokes across the surface. New lines etched themselves into view like frost growing on glass.<br><br>A map. Not of Hogwarts... but of underneath it.<br><br>Passages curled like vines. Some wound downward in spirals. One ended in a symbol—an open eye.<br><br>Harry exhaled. “That’s not on any of the Marauder’s maps.”<br><br>Hermione was already digging in her bag. “I’ve never seen that kind of script. These symbols aren’t Hogwarts standard.”<br><br>Lucas stared at the eye.<br><br>It stared back.<br><br>Below it, a new line began to fade in, as if drawn by invisible ink:<br><br>If you see it, you are the key.<br><br>Lucas’s hand trembled slightly as he traced the words.<br><br>“Guys,” he said quietly, “I don’t think we found a map.”<br><br>He looked up at them, eyes wide.<br><br>“I think the map found me.”' },

{ type: 'text', content: 'A Mission from Professor McGonagall<br><br>Lucas is summoned to the Headmistress’s office—and given a mysterious assignment tied to the map.<br><br>The next morning, Lucas barely made it halfway through his eggs before a gray owl swooped over the Gryffindor table, dropping a parchment envelope directly into his lap.<br><br>It wasn’t the elegant kind Harry or Hermione usually got. This one was short and official.<br><br>“L. Santos — See me at once. —M.M.”<br><br>Lucas blinked. His stomach flipped.<br><br>He’d never been in the Headmistress’s office before.<br><br>Past the gargoyle staircase and through a door that looked more like a vault than anything else, Lucas stood alone, shifting on his feet beneath the high arches and silver gadgets that ticked and turned in impossible directions.<br><br>Professor McGonagall sat behind her desk, framed by afternoon light, spectacles glinting.<br><br>“You’ve caused quite the stir, Mr. Santos,” she said without looking up.<br><br>Lucas opened his mouth, then closed it.<br><br>“I don’t mean that as a reprimand,” she added, finally meeting his eyes. “In fact… I’d like your help.”<br><br>“My help?” he squeaked.<br><br>She nodded. “The parchment you found—Professor Flitwick confirms the enchantment is older than Hogwarts itself. Ancient protective magic. Only reveals itself to a specific magical signature.”<br><br>Lucas blinked. “Mine?”<br><br>“So it seems,” she said. “Which means that map was waiting for you.”<br><br>Lucas stood a little taller.<br><br>McGonagall gestured to a framed star chart on the wall behind her. With a flick of her wand, it dissolved into a glowing window—showing the very same underground map Lucas had discovered. But this version pulsed slowly in time with a faint heartbeat sound.<br><br>“The passage it reveals leads under the north wing,” she said. “To an area the Marauders never mapped. Forgotten by even the founders. Something there is reawakening.”<br><br>She leaned forward.<br><br>“I’m assigning you to a team. Not detention. Not oversight. A mission. With supervision,” she added quickly. “But your instincts—your attention to detail—are exactly what’s needed.”<br><br>Lucas’s heart thundered in his chest.<br><br>“Who’s the team?”<br><br>“You’ll work with Potter and Granger, when possible. I’m adding Neville Longbottom as your mentor. And if you wish—” her eyes softened, “—you may invite your younger brother Caleb to join you. He arrived yesterday afternoon.”<br><br>Lucas’s mouth dropped open. “He’s here?!”<br><br>“In the infirmary for now—magical transit made him queasy,” McGonagall said, almost smiling. “But he’s excited to see you.”<br><br>Lucas’s breath caught somewhere between a laugh and a gasp.<br><br>He had a mission.<br><br>He had backup.<br><br>He had his brother.<br><br>And for the first time, Hogwarts felt less like a mystery and more like… home.' },

Sunlight streamed in through arched windows, making the white sheets on the beds glow like snow. At the far end, half-sitting and clutching a mug of cocoa, was Caleb.<br><br>“Lucas!” he cried, face lighting up.<br><br>Lucas bolted to him. The boys collided in a fierce hug, nearly knocking over the nightstand.<br><br>“You made it,” Lucas whispered, barely able to contain the smile stretching across his face.<br><br>“Wasn’t gonna let you have all the fun,” Caleb replied, muffled by his brother’s shoulder.<br><br>Later that night, back in the common room, the two boys huddled near the fire with Harry, Hermione, and Neville Longbottom—who now served as their official “team captain.”<br><br>Neville set down a rolled map copied from the original Lucas had found. “McGonagall’s given me permission to escort you both as far as the lower passage. After that, it’s you.”<br><br>Lucas glanced at Caleb. His younger brother’s eyes sparkled with nervous excitement.<br><br>Hermione held up a small lantern enchanted with blue fire. “You’ll need this—some of the tunnels dampen wandlight.”<br><br>“And chocolate,” Ron added, tossing them a wrapped bar. “Because everything ends in danger and dementors around here.”<br><br>Lucas laughed.

One path lit up with golden ink.<br><br>“This way,” he whispered.<br><br>They turned, the lantern casting flickering shapes on the walls.<br><br>Soon they came to a small iron door with a crest carved into it—a circle with an eye at the center, surrounded by symbols neither boy recognized.<br><br>The map shimmered again.<br><br>Below the door, new words appeared:<br><br>“To open the gate, speak not your name, but your bond.”<br><br>Lucas and Caleb stood in silence.<br><br>“What does that mean?” Caleb whispered.<br><br>Lucas’s voice was quiet. “Not who you are... but who you are to each other.”<br><br>He took a deep breath.<br><br>Then, together, they said:<br><br>“Brothers.”<br><br>The door creaked open.' },

The only sound was their breath.<br><br>At the center stood a stone pedestal.<br><br>Upon it: nothing.<br><br>But then—the door slammed shut behind them.<br><br>The chamber pulsed. Runes lit around the walls. A voice echoed, low and ancient, not spoken but felt:<br><br>“To walk forward, the brave must stand still.”<br><br>Lucas and Caleb froze.<br><br>“What does that mean?” Caleb whispered.<br><br>“I think it means me,” Lucas said.<br><br>The stone before them began to rise, forming a shifting figure—shadows and fragments building into a faceless silhouette, tall and looming.<br><br>Then it changed—subtle at first. It became… familiar.<br><br>Not a monster.<br><br>Not a villain.<br><br>But a grown-up version of Lucas—stern, cold, disapproving.<br><br>“You’re too reckless,” it said in his voice. “You act like a leader, but you don’t listen. You think being brave means being right.”<br><br>Lucas backed up.<br><br>“You think doing it your way always works,” the shadow hissed. “But one day, you’ll mess up, and someone—he—will get hurt.”<br><br>Its shadowy finger pointed to Caleb.<br><br>“No,” Lucas said quietly.<br><br>The chamber shuddered.<br><br>“I do mess up,” Lucas said louder. “I get mad. I don’t like being told what to do. But that doesn’t mean I’m not trying.”<br><br>The shadow paused.<br><br>“I’m still learning,” Lucas said. “But I’d never let him get hurt. I don’t need to be perfect. I just need to keep going.”<br><br>He stepped forward.<br><br>The shadow flickered—then shattered into ribbons of light.<br><br>A hidden passage cracked open behind the pedestal.<br><br>The runes dimmed.<br><br>Caleb stared at him.<br><br>“You talked it down.”<br><br>Lucas wiped his face with his sleeve. “I guess it wasn’t a monster. It was just... fear pretending to be me.”<br><br>Caleb stepped beside him and took his hand.<br><br>They walked forward together—two boys and one secret mission deeper than anyone had ever dared go.' },

{ type: 'text', content: 'The Secret at the Heart of the Map<br><br>Lucas and Caleb find what the map was leading them to all along—and it’s more than treasure or magic.<br><br>The passage twisted sharply before opening into a cavern that pulsed with soft golden light.<br><br>Lucas and Caleb stepped inside, breath held. The walls were lined with ancient roots—twisting, living things that shimmered with enchantment. At the center stood a pedestal wrapped in vines, and on it: a book. Old, leather-bound, its surface marked with a single glowing rune—the eye from the map.<br><br>They approached carefully.<br><br>Lucas reached out—but didn’t touch it.<br><br>“What is it?” Caleb asked.<br><br>Lucas leaned closer. The map in his hand flared—then dissolved into golden dust. That dust spun into the air… and vanished into the book.<br><br>It unlocked with a soft click.<br><br>Pages flipped open on their own. Inside were drawings—diagrams of Hogwarts, but not just as it was.<br><br>As it could become.<br><br>Rooms that weren’t built yet. Names of future students not yet born. Spells half-invented. Magic not from the past, but from the future.<br><br>“This is… alive,” Lucas whispered.<br><br>Words shimmered across a page:<br><br>Magic doesn’t only remember.<br><br>It dreams.<br><br>Caleb reached for his brother’s hand. “Why did it choose you?”<br><br>Lucas stared at the glowing ink. “Because I noticed it. Because I asked questions. Because I’m not afraid to be the first one through the door.”<br><br>At the bottom of the final page, another message appeared:<br><br>The map begins here—<br><br>But the path goes where you lead.<br><br>The book sealed itself.<br><br>Lucas looked at Caleb.<br><br>“Let’s take it back.”<br><br>“No,” Caleb said. “Let’s carry it forward.”' },

As they stepped into the flickering torchlight of the castle’s lower halls, Lucas felt the castle itself notice them.<br><br>Not as visitors.<br><br>But as part of it.<br><br>Neville met them near the tapestry, eyes wide. “You’re alright! It’s been over four hours—what did you find?”<br><br>Lucas held the book close to his chest. “Something that’s not just Hogwarts’ past.”<br><br>Neville blinked. “What do you mean?”<br><br>Lucas exchanged a glance with Caleb.<br><br>“I mean… it’s Hogwarts dreaming. Thinking ahead. The way people do. It’s magic that wants to grow, not just repeat.”<br><br>Hermione soon joined them, then Harry, and Ron, breathless from running.<br><br>They asked questions—What did it look like? Was it safe? Were there traps? Did it speak? Lucas answered what he could. But when they asked to see inside the book… he hesitated.<br><br>Then quietly said: “Not yet.”<br><br>Back in McGonagall’s office, Lucas placed the book gently on her desk.<br><br>She regarded it with solemn curiosity.<br><br>“I won’t ask you to tell me everything,” she said, fingers tracing the edges of the cover. “But I will ask this: What should we do with it?”<br><br>Lucas thought for a long moment.<br><br>Then: “Let it stay hidden. But not forgotten. Build a team, like you built for me. For others who ask questions. Who notice things.”<br><br>McGonagall nodded once. “Then we’ll protect it. And we’ll be ready.”<br><br>Lucas smiled.<br><br>“Good,” he said. “Because I think Hogwarts is just getting started.”' },

Caleb lay on the rug below, flipping through a comic book by wandlight.<br><br>Neither said much for a long time.<br><br>Then, Caleb spoke without looking up. “Do you think it’s still changing? The book?”<br><br>Lucas thought about that.<br><br>“I think so,” he said. “But not fast. It’s like… the magic in it wants to grow with whoever’s holding it.”<br><br>Caleb closed the comic. “You could’ve kept it.”<br><br>“I know.”<br><br>“But you didn’t.”<br><br>Lucas looked at his brother. “That’s not the kind of magic that should be owned.”<br><br>He slid down next to Caleb, both boys lying on their backs now, staring up at the stone ceiling.<br><br>“Hey,” Caleb whispered, “you were really brave down there.”<br><br>Lucas smirked. “You too.”<br><br>They were quiet again.<br><br>Then Lucas added, “Even when I was scared, I kept thinking about how you were with me.
